A web application anyone can use with any ai endpoint they please.


I know seeing html, js, and css in one file is gross. Please note this application is for people who dont code, simply install the file and open it with your browser, provide the api key and your good to go. 
If you are a developer or know what your doing you can change the model in the code, currently we are using gpt-4o-mini as its the most afforadble and provides frontier level info for topics.
